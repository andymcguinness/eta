Hiya! This is the code for my personal website, [https://andymcguinness.com](https://andymcguinness/com). It's a basic Next.js app with TailwindCSS integration. Thanks for checking it out!

## Getting Started

First, `git clone` the code, then run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the following to start the server (requires `npx`):


```bash
npx run dev
```

Check out [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:300) for results!
